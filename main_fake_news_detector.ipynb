Trump\\u2019s remarks in an interview with Reuters late on Thursday appeared to contrast sharply with comments he made last month when he labeled the EU a \\u201cvehicle for Germany\\u201d, called Brexit a \\u201cgreat thing\\u201d and said more countries would follow Britain out of the bloc.  European diplomats were quick to credit Vice President Mike Pence with persuading his boss of the Union\\u2019s merits after himself being convinced by top EU officials he met in Brussels at the start of the week. Officials said it was unclear, however, if Trump\\u2019s policies would match the pro-EU language which Pence used on Monday or that of White House strategist Steve Bannon, whose scepticism about the bloc had been reflected in Trump\\u2019s earlier comments. As Pence was preparing to fly to Europe to reassure allies that Trump backed the NATO defense pact and wanted cooperation, Bannon told Germany\\u2019s ambassador last week that Washington would deal with individual states, but not the EU. In the Reuters interview, Trump delivered a conciliatory message. When asked if he supported the European Union as a governing body for the continent, he said: \\u201cI do, sure ... The EU, I\\u2019m totally in favor of it. I think it\\u2019s wonderful, if they\\u2019re happy. If they\\u2019re happy, I\\u2019m in favor of it.\\u201d \\u201cPence 1, Bannon 0 - at the end of the first quarter,\\u201d one senior EU official said. \\u201cThese statements clearly, explicitly, go against what Bannon has been saying,\\u201d said another.  \\u201cWe are starting to see traces of pragmatism in Washington,\\u201d a third senior EU foreign policy official said. A senior diplomat spoke of the Union now seeing \\u201csome return on the investment\\u201d in laying out its concerns to Pence over the risk of reversing decades of active U.S. encouragement for Europe to pool its sovereignty and resources. But the question remained: \\u201cWill Trump be saying the same thing tomorrow?\\u201d Asked about Trump\\u2019s new remarks, a Commission spokesman said only that the EU executive read them \\u201cwith interest\\u201d.  On Monday, EU officials said they were reassured that Pence had understood a strong message from European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, in separate meetings, that the EU as a bloc was good for the United States. \\u201cPence clearly understood something in the meeting,\\u201d one EU official said of talks with Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who said that he spoke with unusual directness in the talks. At a news conference, Pence repeatedly name-checked the \\u201cUnion\\u201d as a partner, in contrast to earlier statements on his European visit that focused only on U.S. cooperation with \\u201cEurope\\u201d. Tusk, jailed during Soviet-backed military rule in Poland, seized on Pence bringing up his own youthful travels to divided Cold War Berlin to remind him at the news conference of commitments made by an earlier Republican president, Ronald Reagan.  \\u201cI think Pence was surprised by the strength of Tusk\\u2019s questions and anxiety,\\u201d an EU official said of the earlier meeting between the two men. \\u201cHe said he would take the message back to Trump. It sounds like Trump listened.\\u201d \",\n          \"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter I believe we are in the midst of one of the biggest evolutions in our consciousness we have ever seen. I say this because everywhere you look, things seem to be changing in a very big way. But some back story first.   About 7 years ago, something happened in my life that changed the way I saw myself, my life and the world. I left college for good. I had been through 3 different programs in 3 years trying to figure out what worked for me. I was depressed on and off. I couldn\\u2019t believe that life was simply wake up and go to school until you get a degree. Then, wake up and go to a job you don\\u2019t truly like to make money to support your life until you\\u2019re 60 and then hopefully you can retire. Then, you die. I had to make a change and all along something told me that if I did, everything would be okay. Regardless of what everyone told me my whole life, I knew deeply that I didn\\u2019t (just as you don\\u2019t) have to live life in the way everyone tells you. 5 years ago Collective Evolution was born. A platform that has touched millions of people in a positive way over its 5 years and has changed my life in a positive way. CE likely wouldn\\u2019t be around if I didn\\u2019t choose to leave school for good. I was invited by Columbia University\\u2019s Teacher\\u2019s College to give a TEDx talk as they felt I was an agent of change. Below is that talk and it tells my story as well as what I feel is one of the most important things we need to know and internalize: change starts within. This is what I feel is changing our entire world. Follow Your Passion, It\\u2019s Important The bottom line is, I believe we need to begin following our passions as a first choice when we are young. If we don\\u2019t yet know what our passions are, take the time to enjoy life and figure them out. There is no need to rush into post secondary school so we can get in debt and be stuck in a job for the rest of our lives. This, unfortunately, is a western mentality where we operate under the idea that this is the only way and since people who follow this path are praised and celebrated, many follow the same path.   Even for people who are older and well out of school, it\\u2019s never too late to start doing something new and following your passion. Although there may be financial responsibilities at times, make arrangements and plans to transition into doing something you love. It\\u2019s always possible and there is a way, we just need to begin trying and putting the steps into place. I believe that the moment we truly choose to begin doing something from our hearts, the world around us begins to conspire to make it happen as a result of our conscious desire to make it happen. Since the thoughts might be building, I want to be clear, I am not saying there is no value in education or post secondary school. I am simply stating my belief that it should only be attended when you TRULY know what you want to do, need the education for it and are passion about it. I believe that the education system is designed the way it is for ulterior purposes more so than simply educating with pure intention. More on that below. Does Education Kill Creativity? \\nThe Sacred Science follows eight people from around the world, with varying physical and psychological illnesses, as they embark on a one-month healing journey into the heart of the Amazon jungle. \\nYou can watch this documentary film FREE for 10 days by clicking here. \\n\\\"If \\u201cSurvivor\\u201d was actually real and had stakes worth caring about, it would be what happens here, and \\u201cThe Sacred Science\\u201d hopefully is merely one in a long line of exciting endeavors from this group.\\\" - Billy Okeefe, McClatchy Tribune\",\n          \"Previous The Only Coup Is a Stolen Election \\nWars and rumor of wars. There is no coup. What you are watching is a media distraction. The MSM is actually covering Hillary\\u2019s criminality for the very first time. Are you naive enough to believe the media has had a change of heart? Look at the timing. Most of the early balloting is done. The George Soros\\u2019 voting machines have been placed into 16 key states. Dead people have already early-voted. But the media would have you believe that Hillary cannot win. When the fake polls at ABC show Trump is now leading, you have to question your common sense if you think you are not being played. And getting the people to believe that Hillary cannot win because of the late exposure of her criminality, will keep the people from working hard to prevent it. \\nHow can America be so stupid as to believe that the main stream media has had a change of heart? Chris Matthews endorsing Trump along with other main stream media outlets? Really? Was Santa Claus standing in the background laughing? \\nThe criminal elite and their media pawns have spent the entire election campaign vilifying Trump and now we are to believe that they have found Jesus and are suddenly supporting Trump? For you farm boys, this is called playing possum. \\nIf you don\\u2019t want to live under the biggest criminal to ever run for President, you must block out the media and their minions because if you don\\u2019t and Hillary steals this election, I will be saying I told you so. The only way Trump wins the election, is if the people vote in overwhelming numbers for him and no amount of election fraud can overcome a super majority. For the record, voting machine fraud is designed to flip a percentage of the vote. An overwhelming victory cannot be negated without it being painfully obvious to everyone. So, don\\u2019t get lulled into complacency. Keep working for Trump!!!! \\nBelieve who you want America, but in 5 days, if you lose your focus in supporting Trump and start assuming a victory, you are going to hand the election to Soros and Clinton. \\nHere is the anti-dote to the MSM BS. which is contained in the following video.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"veracity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

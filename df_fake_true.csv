1;"The French Prime Minister has presented his plan to save 40 billion euros. Among his proposals is that patients should no longer have to bear the brunt of healthcare costs by being asked to expire in the shortest possible time. Report.
“We must no longer be a burden on our healthcare system,” reiterated François Bayrou, who said he was counting on the responsibility of patients to “die quickly and well, as part of a republican commitment and to avoid increasing the debt”. “You shouldn't put your long illness before the common good, it's terribly selfish” also repeated the Prime Minister, who wants to make patients aware of the costs borne by society for long, costly treatments when, in any case, everyone is going to die.
To make savings, several avenues are already being explored, such as a tax on palliative care stays, to encourage people to die at home and avoid unnecessarily overcrowding hospitals.";0
2;"The movement founded by Abbé Pierre is facing storage difficulties following new revelations about the priest. Targeted by 12 new accusations of sexual violence, “seven of which concerned minors” at the time of the events, Abbé Pierre is not making Emmaüs' storage work any easier, as it is becoming “very difficult to compile all the accusations of sexual assault” against the priest, according to its president, Bruno Morel. The movement is even considering dedicating one of its buildings exclusively to storing this data. After Emmaus France permanently closed the memorial site dedicated to the priest, in Esteville (Seine-Maritime), and hundreds of streets, squares and buildings were renamed, it is also considering dropping the usual name of its founder from its statutes and presentation, and replacing it with his real name, Henry Grouès, which has the merit of being relatively unknown. Bruno Morel explains: “We could always try to pretend we don't know who he is, by remaining evasive.” Fear of new revelations. 
Initially, Emmaus considered changing its initial mission from “fighting poverty and exclusion” to “fighting sexual misery”. But its president confesses: “We quickly realized with our volunteers that we didn't have the right people to provide this type of service.” So the movement survives as best it can, despite the attacks it regularly comes under, particularly on social networks. Some of those in charge admit that they live ""in fear of new revelations. Bruno Morel adds: “We find out so much every day that sometimes we think we might learn that he collaborated with the enemy, or that he sometimes wore pantacourts.”
In the meantime, following the example of the Fondation Abbé-Pierre, renamed the “Fondation pour le logement des défavorisés”, Emmaüs could quickly change its name to “La fondation qui n'a rien à voir avec l'abbé Pierre”.";0
3;"What is the expected effect of vaccination?
Vaccination involves presenting our body with a part (or the entirety) of a pathogen (virus, bacterium) that has been previously inactivated or attenuated to render it harmless, except in exceptional cases. The vaccinated person reacts against this theoretically inactive (fragment of) pathogen and develops an immune defense that will allow them to destroy the ""true"" pathogen during a subsequent potential infection. Thus, an effective vaccine will, in the event of an epidemic among unvaccinated individuals, prevent infection in vaccinated subjects, who will therefore not spread the disease and, of course, will not die from it. Furthermore, a good vaccine offers protection that extends sufficiently over time so that immune memory does not need to be revitalized every season. A good vaccine offers protection for 10 years or more (diphtheria, tetanus, polio, whooping cough) and in some cases for life (measles, rubella, mumps).
Observation of COVID-19 associated deaths for each age group, before, during, and after vaccination
The main risk factor for COVID-19 is age. Vaccination was therefore logically offered first to older people. Here, we studied the evolution of the percentage of deaths over time, according to age groups, using data published by Santé Publique France. We conducted this study over three distinct periods:
BEFORE vaccination, from March 18, 2020, to January 5, 2021;
DURING vaccination, from January 6, 2021, to December 31, 2021, by which date we reached the vaccination plateau, with more than 90% vaccination in the age groups concerned;
AFTER vaccination, from January 1, 2022, to June 28, 2022.
Since older people were vaccinated first, it was expected that their proportion of COVID-19 associated deaths would significantly decrease starting in spring 2021, reaching a relative minimum in 2022, as explained by the Ministry of Health, vaccination against COVID-19 protects against severe cases and deaths, regardless of the variants.
However, observation of the data reveals a completely different, much less positive message, visible in Figure 1. Figure 1: Evolution of the proportion of each age group in cumulative deaths from March 2020 to December 2021 (top graph), from January 2021 to the end of December 2021 (bottom left graph), and from early January 2022 to the end of June 2022 (bottom right graph). Blue bars represent the share (in %) of each age group in total deaths (left vertical axes), green bars represent the vaccination percentage for each age group at the end of the period (right vertical axes).
We note that the percentage of deaths in the highest age groups does not vary significantly over these three periods.
For those 80 years and older: 62.4% before vaccination, 59.9% during, and 57.8% after;
For those 70-79 years: 22% before vaccination, 23.9% during, and 22% after;
For those 60-69 years: 10.6% before vaccination, 12.3% during, and 11.6% after.
One might think that this stability reflects a uniform vaccine effectiveness across all age groups, thus perfectly preserving the proportions of these different age groups. However, the graphs of the number of deaths by age group (Figure 2) demonstrate that we remain within the same orders of magnitude of deaths (for example, between 28,000 and 29,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths over 12 months for those 80 and older), including for the first 6 months of 2022 during which the Omicron variant became widespread, and for which COVID-19 mortality was quickly reported as very low [1]. Figure 2: Number of deaths in each age group, from March 2020 to the end of December 2020 (top graph), from January 2021 to the end of December 2021 (bottom left graph), and from early January 2022 to the end of June 2022 (bottom right graph). Blue bars represent the number of deaths for each age group (left vertical axes), green bars represent the vaccination percentage for each age group at the end of the period (right vertical axes).
These official public data strongly suggest that the vaccine has absolutely not controlled COVID-19 mortality in France. Furthermore, recent data showing that the lethality of Omicron variants is ~3 times lower than that of previous variants [2] raises questions. We do not observe a decrease in overall mortality. The hypothesis that Omicron's greater contagiousness explains the still high number of deaths in France, however, goes against observations of deaths in sparsely vaccinated countries, such as South Africa, where the vaccination rate is 3 times lower than in France. Figure 3 shows that with a vaccination rate 3 times lower than France, and the same dominance of the Omicron variant (100%), the number of deaths per million inhabitants in South Africa is much lower than in France. Figure 3: Comparison of France / South Africa data. Top left: same proportion of Omicron variant from February 2022 (100% in both countries); Vaccination rate ~3 times lower in South Africa than in France; Daily mortality significantly lower in South Africa than in France. The same period is represented in all three graphs.
Conclusion
It is clear from these data that the proportion of deaths in age groups over 60 remains practically unchanged across the three periods studied: before, during, and after vaccination. This seems to indicate the inability of vaccines to limit COVID-19 mortality in the most vulnerable, despite repeated messages from the Ministry of Health. Yet, the disease itself is now different since the arrival of the less aggressive Omicron variants: it primarily affects the upper respiratory tract and no longer the lungs.
Our political leaders seem to be gradually grasping these on-the-ground realities, as they lifted the health pass this summer, and thus the disguised vaccination mandate. Unfortunately, suspended healthcare workers and firefighters have still not been reinstated, even though both professions are short-staffed during these heatwave times... Common sense should nevertheless lead our leaders to reconsider the merits of these ""punishments"" which are not based on any scientific data.";0

5;"Con: Temperatures were warmer than the present for much of the past 10,000 years. Image: Temperature reconstruction from present day to 11,300 years ago showing the warmer than today period known as the Holocene Climate Optimum. Key Takeaways:
Climate activists and the mainstream media often claim temperatures have reached the “hottest in 125,000 years.”
In reality, temperatures were warmer than the present for much of the past 10,000 years, including most of the time period that human civilization has existed.
The warmer recent past has been long established by many data and sources, including the very first United Nations climate assessment.
Any recent claims of “hottest in 125,000 years” must show with specificity how and why these many long-established temperature histories, which have long agreed with each other, are wrong, yet no compelling evidence has been presented. Short Summary:
Present temperatures are unusually cool, not warm. Scientific data has long shown that temperatures throughout most of the past 10,000 years were as warm or warmer than today. Recent modest warming has not changed that. The unusually cool present temperatures have been reported and demonstrated by multiple peer-reviewed studies, data from the European Science Foundation, and even the very first United Nations climate assessment. 1,2,3,4
Even when we examine longer-term data, present temperatures are unusually cool. We are presently in a warm period between ice age glaciations. Proxy data suggests that every one of the previous six interglacial warm periods were warmer than the present.5,6
When climate activists claim temperatures are the hottest in 125,000 years, they are ignoring and attacking long-established scientific data.
In the image below, scientists plot past temperatures as shown from ice core samples taken from the Greenland ice sheet. The warming of the past 150 years is minor, and temperatures remain unusually cool compared with the past 10,000 years.7 Figure 1. Historic temperatures measured through Greenland ice cores. Since the last ice age glaciation ended 10,000 years ago, temperatures have typically been much warmer than today. Source: Dahl-Jensen et al, Science 283, 268 (1998).
Also, a 2013 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Science reconstructed temperatures from the present back to 11,300 years ago.  As seen in Figure 2, the study confirms temperatures were much warmer during the Holocene Climatic Optimum than the present for most of the past 10,000 years.8,9 Figure 2: Temperature and carbon dioxide change during the Holocene. Black curve, global temperature reconstruction by Marcott et al., 2013. Red curve, CO2 levels as measured reported in Monnin et al., 2004.(reference 10) Importantly, Carbon Dioxide (CO2), in the red line, began increasing 8200 years ago even as temperatures, the black line, went down.
The very first climate assessment report in 1990 from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) agreed. The chart below from the report shows that temperatures during most of the past 10,000 years were warmer than today.11 Figure 3: Temperature history according to the United Nations IPCC First Assessment Report. The top graph shows temperatures during the past 1 million years. The middle graph shows temperatures during the past 12,000 years. The bottom graph shows temperatures during the past 1,000 years. Present temperatures are at the far right. Source: IPCC First Assessment Report, United Nations, p. 202.
In summary, the multitude of credible, long-established scientific evidence conclusively shows that present temperatures are nowhere near the ‘hottest in 125,000 years.";0

10;"A gunman who killed four people when he stormed a skyscraper in the heart of New York on Monday evening left a note that appeared to blame the National Football League (NFL) for a brain injury, the city's Mayor Eric Adams says.
The attacker, 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas, shot himself dead after opening fire in a building where the American football league has its headquarters, but went to a different part of the building after taking the wrong lift.
The gunman was carrying a note in which he blamed CTE, a brain disease triggered by head trauma, for his mental illness, Adams said.
Tamura played football as a teenager but did not play in the NFL, ex-teammates have told US media.
New York City police officer Didarul Islam, 36 - who was working as a security guard at the building - was among those killed.
Another of the victims was an employee of finance giant Blackstone, who was named by her company as Wesley LePatner.
Two male civilians were also killed. An NFL employee was also ""seriously injured"" in the attack, the league's commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a message to staff.
Asked about a possible motive, Adams told CBS: ""[He] did have a note on him. The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports.
""He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury.""
Tamura was a football player during his time at high school in California, ex-teammates earlier told NBC News.
The gunman appears to have driven across the US from Las Vegas to New York, and used an assault-style rifle during the attack. After opening fire in the lobby, Tamura is believed to have entered a lift to the 33rd floor of the skyscraper and continued to open fire.
Mayor Adams said a preliminary investigation shows that the gunman mistakenly went to the office of Rudin Management, which owns the building.
Tamura later turned his gun on himself.
The incident brought parts of Midtown Manhattan and public transportation to a halt. A BBC journalist at the scene reported seeing scores of police vehicles and at least one person with a bloodied chest being taken away on a stretcher.
Bystanders reported hearing what sounded like gunshots and police told those in the area, including the BBC journalist, to shelter in nearby buildings.
Police worked floor-by-floor to clear the building, an effort that took hours.
One woman, Nekeisha Lewis, said she was eating dinner with friends on the plaza when she heard gunfire. ""It felt like you were in a warzone almost,"" she told NBC News.
Ms Lewis said she saw an injured man run out of the building, and described the incident as ""literally the most scary situation I've ever been in"".";1
11;"You sent us a video in which an alleged Mexican doctor advocates for the use of CDS (Chlorine Dioxide Solution) to treat COVID-19, claiming it's a ""purer and more effective"" treatment than MMS (Miracle Mineral Solution), which contains sodium chlorite. He also provides a series of explanations on dosage for treating children. This information is false. There is no scientific evidence that chlorine dioxide or sodium chlorite are effective treatments for COVID-19, and their consumption is dangerous.
""We are very interested in CDS, as it is a purer and more effective treatment [than MMS] for treating COVID-19.""
Organizations such as the U.S. FDA, the WHO (through the Pan American Health Organization, PAHO), and the Spanish Medicines Agency have issued statements highlighting the danger of chlorine dioxide (found in both MMS and CDS), unequivocally stating that consuming these compounds is equivalent to simply drinking ""bleach."" Indeed, they are ""the active ingredients in some disinfectants"" and ""are not intended for human ingestion."" Furthermore, these organizations emphasize that ""their ingestion or inhalation can cause severe side effects,"" including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) has also issued a warning, stating that ""there is no scientific evidence supporting these supposed properties, and these products have not undergone any form of scientific evaluation or authorization by the competent authorities to guarantee a positive benefit-risk ratio and thus ensure citizens' right to health protection."" In 2010, it had already issued an informative note on the risk of their use, ""given that products attributed with curative and preventive properties that do not have the mandatory authorizations are in violation of current regulations.""
The presentation of CDS or MMS as an alternative treatment for COVID-19 is not new. False studies have even been published in what are known as predatory journals – those not listed in the official list of serious and globally recognized scientific publications – with the aim of legitimizing the supposed effectiveness of these alleged COVID-19 treatments. In this specific case, this misinformation was disseminated by Manuel Aparicio, director and owner of the Jurica Medical Center in Querétaro (Mexico), who had already been mentioned in other articles, such as this one published by the Associated Press, due to his false statements.";1
12;"A new telomere repair mode unveiled
November 24, 2017
Scientific Findings
Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that protect the ends of chromosomes and shorten with each cell division. This natural erosion of telomeres reflects successive cell divisions and is a marker of cellular aging. Using a yeast model, Stéphane Coulon and Vincent Géli at the Cancer Research Center of Marseille reveal that eroded telomeres are subject to chromosomal rearrangements in quiescent cells. Remarkably, these modifications reduce the ability of these cells to proliferate upon exiting quiescence. This work was published on November 22, 2017, in the journal Nature Communications.
Cell divisions cause telomere shortening which, beyond a critical threshold, limits the proliferative capacity of most cells in an organism. Embryonic stem cells and germ cells escape this anti-proliferative barrier because they express telomerase, an enzyme capable of lengthening telomeres. In adults, natural telomere attrition is primarily observed in somatic cells but also in stem cells where telomerase activity is reduced or absent. The natural attrition of telomeres can impair stem cell functions by limiting their ability to enter and exit quiescence to, for example, ensure tissue regeneration.
Telomere maintenance mechanisms are well-studied in dividing cells but remain poorly understood in quiescent (non-dividing) cells. It has been shown that DNA damage can lead to telomere shortening in quiescent cells, particularly in neurons and muscle cells. The researchers investigated the fate of dysfunctional telomeres in quiescent cells. To study the mechanisms governing the maintenance of short telomeres in quiescent cells, they used yeast cells whose quiescence can be metabolically induced. While telomeres in a wild-type strain are stable in quiescence, they observed that eroded telomeres are strongly rearranged in the absence of telomerase. Unexpectedly for quiescent cells, these rearrangements correspond to duplications of subtelomeric regions.
These specific rearrangements, never observed before, depend on a DNA repair pathway called homologous recombination which primarily operates in dividing cells. The researchers discovered that the mechanism by which these rearrangements occur involves the transcription of non-coding RNA in these subtelomeric regions. Surprisingly, these duplications in the subtelomeric regions decrease the cells' ability to initiate a new cell cycle.
In summary, this work highlights a new mode of telomere repair specific to post-mitotic yeast cells that limits the ability of these cells to exit quiescence.";1
13;"A young Lithuanian woman was struggling to conceive with her partner — a rare but shocking allergy was to blame for her infertility, according to a new case report in a medical journal.
For the 29-year-old patient, four years of natural attempts and two rounds of IVF proved ineffective, stumping her doctors.
Since she’s asthmatic with a sensitivity to mold, cat fur and dust, the woman suspected that her allergies might be a contributing factor. Subsequent blood tests revealed that she had high levels of eosinophils, a white blood cell that defends the body against allergens. In addition to her established allergies, skin tests showed allergic sensitivity to mites, pollen, insects and dogs. Tests also pinpointed high sensitivity to the protein Can f 5, found in dog dander and urine, which has been linked to potential sensitivities toward human semen.
The woman shared with her allergist that she frequently experienced nasal congestion and sneezing after having unprotected sex with her partner. Using samples from her partner’s semen, doctors confirmed that she has a semen allergy. A semen allergy, also known as seminal plasma hypersensitivity (SPH), is a rare reaction to proteins found in male spermatic fluid, according to the Cleveland Clinic. SPH is recognized as a Type 1 hypersensitivity, characterized by a rapid, exaggerated immune response to an allergen, putting semen in the same category as peanuts and pet dander.
For those afflicted, reactions to exposure to ejaculate run the gamut from burning, itching, redness and swelling of the vulva or vagina to hives, shortness of breath, dizziness and even anaphylaxis.
The primary treatment for SPH is condoms, but in this case, the woman was determined to conceive with her partner and eschewed the latex solution.
SPH does not directly cause infertility, though conception can be challenging.
Treatments for would-be parents include antihistamine medication before intercourse, anti-inflammatories after and/or desensitization therapy using diluted seminal plasma. In cases where the allergic reaction is severe, some couples turn to using washed sperm free from seminal plasma in IVF treatments to divert the allergic trigger. Desensitization therapy was unavailable in Lithuania, and the patient found antihistamines before sex to be “ineffective” at managing her reactions.
During a follow-up visit three years later, the woman disclosed that she was still unable to conceive and, worse still, her allergic symptoms had expanded to include eye irritation and a burning sensation in her vulva.
Her case was detailed last year in the journal Frontiers in Medicine.
SPH was initially documented in 1967, when a woman was hospitalized following a “violent allergic reaction” to sex.
For the next three decades, it was assumed that SPH affected fewer than 100 women worldwide.
Yet, a 1997 study led by allergist Jonathan Bernstein revealed that nearly 12% of reported postcoital symptoms could be classified as SPH.
The condition is now believed to affect one in 40,000 people.";1
14;"One of Hollywood’s most recognizable and bankable stars wants to apologize if he fails to recognize you. 
In a recent interview, Brad Pitt claimed that he suffers from a rare neurological disorder known as prosopagnosia. Better known as “face blindness,” the condition limits your ability to recognize the faces of others, sometimes even close friends and relatives.
Though he has not been officially diagnosed, Pitt says he has extreme difficulty recognizing other people’s faces. He adds that some have labeled him self-absorbed or conceited, thinking he’s lying about having face blindness.
Premier Health Now spoke with Fadi M. Tayim, PhD, a clinical neuropsychologist and Division Chief of the Brain Mapping Center at the Clinical Neuroscience Institute, to learn more about prosopagnosia and how it is diagnosed.
Hello, Stranger
“Because of its rarity, prosopagnosia can be difficult to diagnose and there are even varying levels of severity,” says Dr. Tayim. “It is caused more commonly because of trauma such as a stroke or brain injury, which causes damage to a fold of the brain associated with facial perception. It can also occur as a congenital defect that someone is born with.”
According to the National Institutes of Health, prosopagnosia is an extremely rare condition believed to occur in about two percent of the general population. Studies have shown that the average person is able to recognize and remember thousands of faces throughout their lifetime. But those who suffer from face blindness can struggle to make those same basic connections.
Prosopagnosia specifically affects your visual recognition of other people. It’s not the result of memory loss, such as the inability to remember a person’s name even though you may recognize their face.
Dr. Tayim says, “I would encourage anyone who thinks they might be suffering from face blindness to get in touch with their primary care physician, who can then refer them to a neurologist or neuropsychologist for further testing.
“There are a series of facial recognition tests and tasks that can be performed, as well as imaging tests such as MRI that can be used to help identify any changes in the brain.”  ";1
